# NBA Sprint Project ML model

The goals of this part of the project are:

* Selecting evaluation metrics and baseline models
* Perform feature engineering and standarization
* Training and using predictive models: Univariable and Multivariate Linear Regression, Classification
* Understand how Gradient Descent works by implementing a Linear Regressor in python

## Parts

The project is divided in 3 main parts:
* Using Regression Models to Estimate players Salaries
* Star or no Star? Predicting players All-NBA selections
* Developing a Linear Regressor class from scratch

### Collecting information for building our dataset

In this first part, I'll be using SGDRegressor to make a single feature model and a multi-feature one.
Also, I'll make a DecisionTreeRegressor model and compare them.

### Star or no Star? Predicting players All-NBA selections

The objective of this part of the project is to predict which players are going to be selected to ALL-NBA teams at the end of the season.
This is a binary classification task, so I'm going to train a classifier model to solve this problem.

### Developing a Linear Regressor class from scratch
 
The objective of this part of the project is to code a Linear Regression algorithm using Gradient Descent as its optimization algorithm in Python.

##  Files

There is an .ipynb file of the project called AnyoneAI_Project_2.ipynb with all the parts mentioned before.

## Previous Part

In the previous repository, I did the first steps before performing an ML model where I had to collect information, data cleaning and preprocessing, and visualize data.
